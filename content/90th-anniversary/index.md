For 48 years during two World Wars and the Cold War men and women from seven nations serving in 50 squadrons were responsible for the defence of London and its community.  Since then commercial flying, the restoration of historic aircraft, leisure flying and gliding have replaced defence operations thereby maintaining an active and vibrant airfield.  In order to create a permanent memorial to all who have kept North Weald alive in War and Peace a stained glass window has been installed in the Airfield Museum entrance hall.</font></font></p>
