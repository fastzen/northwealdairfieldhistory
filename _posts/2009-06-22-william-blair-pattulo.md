Russell Moul, who also led the service at the house.&nbsp; After the unveiling, refreshments were served in St Paul&rsquo;s Church Hall giving guests the opportunity to circulate and reminisce.<br /><br />The plaque was the inspiration of SAC Joel M E Diggle of RAF Coltishall who arranged the event.&nbsp; Everyone involved thought it was a superbly organised occasion.<br />&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On the 25th October 1940 a schoolboy had witnessed the crash and saw the pilot removed from the plane by the emergency services.&nbsp; He was Geoff Walton and 50 years later he decided to research the crash and find out who the pilot was.&nbsp; He discussed the project with Norman Jennings, a former teacher at the school Geoff attended.&nbsp; They determined to research it together.&nbsp; After finding that the pilot was P/O Pattullo the rest was not easy.&nbsp; The problem was that P/O Pattullo was born in Chile of Scots parents who were working there.&nbsp; To make things more difficult the birth was not recorded at the British Consulate for seven years.&nbsp; The story of how they traced the family is told in their book, &ldquo;Search for One of the Few&rdquo;, by Norman Jennings and Geoff Walton.<br /><br /><img height="510" width="680" alt="Unveiling of the memorial plaque to William Blair Pattulo" src="{{ site.JB.BASE_PATH }}/images/Patullo_unveil.jpg" /></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><img class="article" height="440" width="250" align="left" src="{{ site.JB.BASE_PATH }}/images/Patullo_JDiggle2.jpg" alt="Mrs Annette Pattulo Martin and SAC Joel M E Diggle" />&nbsp;When P/O Pattullo was 19 he left Chile to come to the UK to join the RAF. &nbsp;Hence the reason for the presence of Chilean Defence Attach&eacute;.</p><p><img hspace="10" height="313" width="410" align="bottom" alt="The Mayor of Harold Hill and guests at the memorial event" src="{{ site.JB.BASE_PATH }}/images/Patullo_group_0_0.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &copy;&nbsp; W H Aitken&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Photographs&nbsp; E M Aitken<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>
