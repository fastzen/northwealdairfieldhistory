Hunters, Gnats, and Jet Provosts represent post war jets. There is a swarm of Yaks and recent arrivals include an Estonian registered L29 Delfin and a Canadair built T33 Silver Star in USAF Thunderbirds markings.<br /><br />Steeped in history for more than 85 years, North Weald airfield is an ideal place to start your Aviation Heritage Tour. Many former WW2 airfield sites are within easy reach along with important Aviation Heritage sites. The well-known aviation museums Duxford, Hendon and the De Haviland and Shuttleworth collections are easy to get to. Stansted and London City Airports are within easy reach as are Andrewsfield and Stapleford airfields.<br /><br />Regular events are held at the airfield.&nbsp; As well as flying and static aircraft displays there are large numbers of suppliers of memorabilia, books etc.&nbsp; A regular visitor is <a href="http://www.aircraftbooks.com/">Derek Vanstone</a> Aviation Books.<br /><br />Access to the airfield is restricted but group tours can be arranged, subject to adequate notice and the airfield managers&rsquo; agreement.
