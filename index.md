The airfield is still very active, and on most summer week-ends visitors may see some of the veteran and classic aircraft based on the airfield, such as the Spitfire, Mustang, Invader, Vampire, Hunter, Dakotas, Yaks and Jet Provosts, land and take-off.</p><p><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><br /><img class="article" height="201" width="269" align="left" alt="North Weald Airfield Museum" src="{{ site.JB.BASE_PATH }}/images/Museum535.JPG" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br>The airfield also has a museum, and North Weald Airfield Museum is all about people. It's about the service personnel and civilians, who have lived, worked, flown, fought and died here since the airfield opened in 1916. <br /><br />The museum sets out to tell their story of a famous airfield that has protected London during two world wars.&nbsp; The story is told in displays, with photographs, artefacts and personal memories.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><img class="article" height="202" width="269" align="right" src="{{ site.JB.BASE_PATH }}/images/56_Sqd_group.jpg" alt="56 Squadron" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p>The NWAMA Collection is housed in the former RAF North Weald Station Office. The extensive collection of photographs and artefacts is displayed in theme rooms that tell the story of the airfield and its people from 1916 to the present day.&nbsp; It is without doubt one of the best documented former RAF stations. There is access to an extensively researched history of the airfield. The area is enhanced by the new Memorial. Combine a visit to the Museum and the RAF North Weald Memorial, dedicated to all who served at North Weald.
